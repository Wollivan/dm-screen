# 3D Printable DM Screen

##Â Instructions to print

For this screen you need 2 `end-screens.stl`s (one for each... end).
Print as many `mid-screens.stl`s as you like. Go nuts. Want 7? do it.

Print as many hinges as you need (you can figure it out) and to make the hinges hinge, use a piece of filament.

I recomend testing tolerances first by printing a hinge and seeing how well the filament fits on the holes.

## Tips

Use a 3D printer.
