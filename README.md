## What is?

A GM screen is a screen for a **G**ame **M**aster to hide their secret plans from their nosey players.
## Instructions to print

For this screen you need 2 `end-screens.stl`s (one for each... end).
Print as many `mid-screens.stl`s as you like. Go nuts. Want 7? do it.

Print as many hinges as you need (you can figure it out) and to make the hinges hinge, use a piece of filament.

## Hinge Tolerance

I recommend testing tolerances first by printing a hinge and seeing how well the filament fits in the holes. You can adjust this by editing the `filamentD` variable in `main.scad`. Remember you will then need to generate the 3 STLs again with the new value.

## Cairn RPG Inserts

Visit the [inserts page](https://wollivan.github.io/gm-screen/inserts) to print the inserts sized specifically for this screen for the Cairn RPG. There are multiple pages to choose from, as well as blank pages should you want them.

## Tips

Use a 3D printer.
